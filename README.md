"Optimization Functions" - This folder contains the global functions which are called in each FO experiment. The functions in this folder must be globally accessible.

"179-Bus Power System" - This folder contains the experiment related to the multiple FOs which are applied to the WECC 179-bus power system.

"4-Bus Power System" - This folder contains the experiment related to the single FO which is applied to the custom 4-bus power system.
